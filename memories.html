<h2>A tiny expression of howmuch you mean to me....</h2>

    <p class style="font-size:20px;">
      To the Queen that rules my heart,spending time with you is the favourite part of the day,I like how ordinary days became special with you and how love feels softer with you, even 2 days of not meeting you feels like it has been weeks, 	you are an absolute package, you are a Princess, a Baby, and a Gangster. It's a 3 for 1 special. Soft enough to feel everything, tough enough to survive anything. Cries to little things, then Bosses up like nothing happend. Heart so deep like an ocean and boundaries like a Bodyguard, I Love the way how you cherish all the small things I do for you, let it be something as small as giving you a chocolate, you get happy and your eyes light up like a babyy, that face of yours gives me so much of happiness, I like how you notice and enjoy every small things that happen around our daily life, I like the part in you where you adore, relish, appreciate the little of littlest of things that happen and enjoy every moment and live it like a small little baby unlike me😂, that happy face of yours makes me wanna do anything for you no matter what, all I wan't to see is that kid inside you feel happy and heal itself ,Generally I am an expression-less and very serious person but with you all shades of my expressions come alive(magic hahahahaha), The feeling of Hugging you and Holding you in arms like a small baby is absolutely Surreal and beyond words. I wanna see a you as a successful and a sassy woman in the future and I know you will be one. I like way how things started between us starting from when I had a crush on you in the first year and later thought things would'nt happen and just leaving it there and then starting to become friends during the ending time of college where we starting talking more about each other and me eventually falling for you again, and there we go, we never knew we would come this far, Destiny hits!, we are together now and I am so Happy about that all though I don't express it.(ik it's just me being me😂) I love the way how you are so caring, understanding and empathetic about me and support me for everything and always ready to do anything for me and love me like a small kid, you held my hand and lifted me when I was nothing and facing a bad time of life and I am so greateful about that, thank you for Healing the parts in me that needed to be healed and making me believe in Love deeper and stronger, Love you beyond infinity, 
I hope this continues forever and also hope we both get the crazy crazy future and growth, wealth in life we desire for. Take care of your health and rest well and stop overthinking about the things that don't matter to you and isn't in your control, nothing is your fault, it's just life, you're really precious, I know we always want to be with each other the whole day but we know it's not possible and we have to let go of each other at the end of the day, that's my hatest part of the day when we have to leave each other, my heart breaks each time when I see that sad face of yours and you screeching when we gotta leave, but then I'm excited to see you again soon. Cheers to Us! Thank you somuch for everything boo.    Here are certain cute pictures of you enjoying few moments 💗
